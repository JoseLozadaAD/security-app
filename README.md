# POC (springboot-react-keycloak-oauth2.0-pkce-hexagonal-architecture)

The goal of this project is to secure `game-app` using [`Keycloak`](https://www.keycloak.org/)(with PKCE). `game-app` consists of two applications: one is a [Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/) Rest API called `game-api` and another is a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) application called `game-web`.

## Summary

`game-app` is a web application to watch, create, update and delete our favorites games and comment these, we have three types of roles:

* `ADMIN`: They can watch, create, update, and delete games also they can comment on games and watch his profile.
* `USER`: They can watch the games, they can comment on games and watch his profile.
* `NON-REGISTER-USER`: They just can watch the existing games.

## Application

- ### game-api

  `Spring Boot` Web Java backend application that exposes a REST API to manage **games**. Its secured endpoints can just be accessed if an access token (JWT) issued by `Keycloak` is provided. It's implementing

  `game-api` is implemented using the [`hexagonal architecture`](https://github.com/thombergs/buckpal) 
  
  `game-api` stores its data in a [`MySQL`](https://www.mysql.com/) database.

  `game-api` has the following endpoints

  | Endpoint                                                          | Secured | Roles                       |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------|
  | `GET /api/games`                                                  | No      |                             |
  | `GET /api/games/{id}`                                             | No      |                             |
  | `POST /api/games`                                                 | Yes     | `ADMIN`                     | 
  | `PUT /api/games`                                                  | Yes     | `ADMIN`                     | 
  | `DELETE /api/games`                                               | Yes     | `ADMIN`                     | 
  | `GET /api/users`                                                  | Yes     | `ADMIN` and `USER`          |
  | `POST /api/games/*/comments`                                       | Yes     | `ADMIN` and `USER`          |

- ### game-ui

  `ReactJS` frontend application where `users` can watch and comment on games and `admins` can manage games. In order to access the application, `user` / `admin` must login using his/her username and password. Those credentials are handled by `Keycloak`. All the requests coming from `game-ui` to secured endpoints in `game-api` have a access token (JWT) that is generated when `user` / `admin` logs in.
  
  `game-ui` uses [`Semantic UI React`](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) as CSS-styled framework.

## Prerequisites

- [`Java 17+`](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17)
- [`XAMPP`](https://www.apachefriends.org/es/download.html)
- [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com/)

## Start Environment

- If you are using XAMPP, first create a database in [`phpMyAdmin`](http://localhost/phpmyadmin/) with a name
  ```
  world_gamer_db
  ```

- To run docker type this command in a terminal
  ```
  docker run -p 8080:8080 -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin --name keycloak quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:21.0.0 start-dev
  ```
- Once the container is up enter to [`keycloak`](http://localhost:8080/admin/)
  
- and there create the Realm: `world-game-app`  
- in the Realm settings go to Login options and enable the User Registration switch  
- then create Client: `game-app`  
- config the Client: ![keycloak client configuration](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1BvOfDQxlfz0BmjNvXeD-1BTN6CUMYwPX)   
- create the Client Roles: `ADMIN` and `USER`
- finally in the Realm roles options set the default roles up with the USER role
